### Hello there!

I write software for a living and on this site you'll find some of my fun practice projects, usually about these topics:
```diff
+ Non-Profits | Startups | Sports | Tech Ideas
```

More and more, I practice:
```diff
+ Agile Methodology | Clean Architecture | SOLID Principles | Test-Driven Development
```

I work mainly in the Microsoft tech stack, using the following technologies (though I have experience with other frameworks):
```diff
+ ASP.NET Core 6.0 | Azure | Blazor Server | Bootstrap | Bunit | Entity Framework | Identity | Moq | NUnit | SQL Server | Swagger
```
